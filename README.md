## What is SongScraper?
SongScraper is a program designed by me, for all those people who want to search for songs, albums etc of an artist, but for example they don't remember the name or cover of the single/album.

## What language is SongScraper written in?
SongScraper is written in JavaScript (Node.JS), HTML5 and CSS3 and it's based on electron, a Javascript framework that let you create apps from web pages, and uses [Deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com/api).

## What do I need to do to get SongScraper fully working?
SongScraper is based off NodeJS, so you need to first downloada NodeJS by [clicking here](https://nodejs.org/en/download), then you have to downlaod this repository. After doing this you need to put the repository in a folder, and open that folder with a code editor, like Visual Studio Code or WebStorm.   When you did these steps, you can open a terminal from the IDE and run ```npm install``` to install all the packages that SongScraper needs for working.  After doing all these things, you can simply run the application by using in the terminal ```npm start```.

## What i have to do for search a song/artist?
You can simply go to the search bar, type the artist/song/album name and it will display all the possible songs correlated to that artist/album.
